The floating-point benchmarks from John Walter can be downloaded from his site:
http://www.fourmilab.ch/fbench/

For better results, please compile with debug information (GCC: -g) and without
optimizations (GCC: -O0).

If the examples are compiled with the GCC, one can specify whether the x87 FPU or
the newer SSE instructions should be used for floating-point arithmetic:
	x87 FPU: 	-mfpmath=387
	SSE:		-mfpmath=sse
